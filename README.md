# VOCAMATE 🧠📚 (On going project)

**VOCAMATE** is a multilingual vocabulary learning app (English, Vietnamese, Korean) built with **Flutter** and **Firebase**. It helps language learners expand their vocabulary through interactive lessons, flashcards, and a gamified learning environment.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔤 **Flashcard-based vocabulary learning** – Supports EN/VI/KR with both curated lessons and user-created word sets.
- 🧠 **Level-based lesson system** – Unlock new lessons by completing previous ones.
- 🎮 **Gamification and rewards** – Earn points and buy avatar/profile decorations.
- 📝 **Daily writing Feed** – Practice using learned vocabulary in short posts.
- ✅ **Vocabulary-focused scoring** – Grammar is not enforced, only vocabulary usage matters.
- 💬 **Community feedback system** – Users can correct each other’s posts to gain additional rewards.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- ⚙️ **Flutter** – Cross-platform mobile development.
- ☁️ **Firebase** – Firestore, Firebase Auth.
- 📦 **RestAPI** – Store and fecth data for lessons and vocabulary.
- 🎨 **Google Fonts, Font Awesome** – Clean, modern UI.

## 👨‍💻 What I finished 

- Developed full **sign-up and login flow** using local data (Firebase Auth integration planned).
- Designed the **main app interface**, inspired by gamified style + bottom navigation.
- Implemented navigation structure and screen routing.
- Structured the project with **scalable, clean architecture** – avoided temporary or throwaway code.
